# DESCRIPTION: Install Apache, MySQL and PHP on macOS High Sierra
#     VERSION: 0.8
# REFERENCE 1: https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-sierra-apache-multiple-php-versions
# REFERENCE 2: https://praxent.com/blog/native-lamp-stack-mac-os-x

###############################################################################

# This script
# - Installs Homebrew if not installed
# - Installs XCode Command Line Tools if not installed
# - Installs Apache with Homebrew
# - Creates ~/Sites directory if not exists
# - Confgiures Apache conf file using sed
# - Confgiures Apache Virtual Hosts
# - Installs PHP with Homebrew
# - Installs common PHP Extensions (e.g. mcrypt required by OpenCart)
# - Confgiures PHP conf file using sed
# - Installs MariaDB with Homebrew
# - Installs Sequel-Pro with Homebrew Cask
# - Installs Dnsmasq with Homebrew and configures it


# TODO
# - [x] Test the script 
# - [ ] Make a copy of conf files before editing them
# - [ ] Try the Include directive to include a new file with your settings instead of directly editing the main conf files - 
#       e.g. `Include /Users/amariwan/Sites/*.conf` - will include all .conf files in the Site folders in the main httpd.conf
#       (more: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#include)
#       https://gist.github.com/vitorbritto/4fea3514fa09ef298b1f
# - [ ] If not using Include, append our changes to the end of the file instead of editing settings in place. The later ones will override the ones that came before
# - [ ] Move conf files to the Sites folder for easy access
# - [x] Add logs folder inside Sites directory
# - [x] Check if brew packages are already installed (httpd, php70, mariadb, sequel-pro, dnsmasq)
